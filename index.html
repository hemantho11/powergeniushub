						<strong><i>Fox News - It's no secret that residents in <span class="regionName"></span> overpay
								for electricity because the power companies have a monopoly over them. This genius new
								invention will save you up to thousands of dollars a year off your electric

					</p>
					<p>
						Elon Musk, the genius CEO behind solar power giant Tesla has been the talk of the town lately.
						<b>His most recent controversy is a genius electricity saving invention for those who can't
							afford fancy, expensive solar panels. </b>The
						electric power companies are furious and want Elon's money saving invention banned before the
						American public can take full advantage of the savings.
					</p>

					<p>He goes on to say <b>"The big power companies are scamming you.</b> Yes, that's right. Believe it
						or
						not, they have been using a secret to cheat you every time you run your lights, dishwasher,
						blender,
						vacuum and anything else that draws power. This is why your power bill is so expensive every
						month
						and keeps rising with some
						<b><span class="regionName"></span> residents paying as much as $500 a month</b>
						in electric bills. Every American can slash their electricity bill by 90% using this
						revolutionary
						technology. You're welcome, America."

						<b> Pictured: Our readers old bill vs. new bill after using Elon's invention.</b>
					</div>
					<p>How bad is this little known scam? A new study reports that together
						<b>Americans overpay up to $27.6 billion dollars a year</b> on their electric bill due to this!
					</p>

					<p>But for Elon Musk, this was more than just an invention to fight back against the greedy electric
						companies.
						<b>When tragedy struck the Tesla factory, he knew he had to take action. Dorothy Smith was a 64
							year old Tesla employee who died of a heat stroke after falling behind on her electric bills
							and her service was shut off in the middle of a record breaking heat wave. Her youngest
							daughter came to check up on her after many unanswered phone calls and tragically found
							Dorothy lifeless on the couch with her husband. </b>
					</p>

					<p>"The heat just got her. She had no power, no air conditioning, can you imagine? She was very
						prideful
						and ashamed to ask for help.
						<b>No one knew she fell behind and couldn't afford to pay for the high electric bills
							anymore.</b>
						She was always a very active person, always around the house, nothing could stop her."
						<b>Tragedies like this can happen to any American family as they ask themselves every month
							should I buy groceries to eat or pay my $400 electric bill to keep the lights on? Dorothy's
							story is every American's story. We dedicate this report in her loving memory.</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<div class="img">

						</a>
					</div>
					<p></p>
					<p>"This tragedy shook up the Tesla plant as they mourned their fallen colleague. Many employees
						asked
						me how could they help? I was personally devastated when I heard the news.
						<b>Dorothy was such a kind soul and integral to the team's success. She worked so hard and was
							looking forward to retiring soon. The immoral electric power industry is completely out of
							control with their price gouging during these tough times. </b>
						They should not be allowed to shut off power during these times and these rising prices are not
						sustainable for the average American family who are just trying to make ends meet. I will make
						sure
						to dedicate this important project not only to Dorothy's memory but to humanity itself. This
						project
						is so very important to us." - Elon Musk
					</p>
					<p></p>


					<p><b><i>"After Dorothy's death, I began reading all of these reports coming out showing how the
								price of electricity has continously risen over the years in the USA and it was
								concerning because I know people are struggling to pay bills while electric company CEOs
								get richer. There are thousands of Dorothy's out there who fall behind at some point and
								can't afford to keep paying." </i></b>

					<p>
						<b>Of course, no one in Washington cares that the American people are being scammed</b> and the
						Public Utility Commission doesn't care to fix this crooked business of overcharging electricity
						to
						consumers – because they are likely benefiting from it too.
					</p>
					<h2>The Perfect Storm For Innovation...</h2>


					<p>Seeing just how devastating electricity prices are on the average American's wallet, and
						witnessing
						his own employee, Dorothy Smith pass away tragically, Elon Musk set out to find his old drawing
						plans for an <b>electricity saver invention</b> he had made as a young genius in South Africa.
						The
						original drawing was based on a concept by his idol, legendary inventor, electrical and
						mechanical
						engineer and visionary, <b>Nikola Tesla.</b>
					</p>

					<p>After a few hours of digging through old papers, he found it! Elon immediately called one of his
						brightest engineers at Tesla and trusted friend, Ed Sherwood. Combining their expertise, they
						set
						out to bring Elon's <b>electricity saving dream</b> to life.</p>





					<p>After a few weeks of work in a back room of the Tesla factory, they had a finished project. It
						was a
						source of happiness after so many weeks of sorrow mourning the death at the Tesla factory.
					</p>
					<div class="img">
						<a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">

						</a>
					</div>

					<p>Combining their experience they came up with a ground-breaking device
						<b>that helps you not only lower your electric bill, but can also increase the lifespan on
							expensive household appliances</b>
						because of all the energy it conserves.
					</p>

					<b>
						<p>They created what's being called the most important invention since the printing press!
						</p>
					</b>

					<p>They dubbed it, the <a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank"><b>
								Stop Watt!</b></a>
					</p>

					</div>


					<h2>How Do Power Companies Scam the Public? How Does the Stop Watt Work?</h2>

					<p>Stop Watt is a small, compact, affordable, and
						<b>easy-to-use plug-in device that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables
							in your home and lowers your consumption instantly.</b>
						You just plug it in and let this smart device work it's magic. It's easy to connect, simply plug
						into the outlet closest to your breaker box. That is all you need to do, once plugged in the
						green
						LED indicates it is powered on and working.
					</p>

					<p>The fact is, all appliances draw more power than they need to run, due to inefficiencies and
						noise on
						the sine wave created by the electric companies to overcharge customers and scam them.
						<b>Power companies take advantage of this situation, and overcharge their customers for it. Due
							to their monopoly, the government is unwilling to step in and address this situation.</b>
					</p>

					<p>The Stop Watt reduces this noise, thereby decreasing the amount of electricity used. So
						none is
						wasted.
						<b>It doesn’t change the meter reading, or steal power from anywhere else, it simply uses the
							energy more efficiently, so less is needed.</b>
					</p>
					<p>Within just 24 hours, it makes more efficient use of the total energy draw resulting in energy
						savings.
						<b>Your next power bill should be signifigantly lower as it becomes accustomed to the energy use
							in your home and stops excess electricity from enterting the electric cables.</b>
					</p>


					<div class="img">
						<a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">

						</a>
					</div>
					<p><b>"Stop Watt is your power company's worst nightmare" says Elon.</b> They have been trying
						to
						hide Stop Watt from the everyday consumer and have banned it in retail shops leaving it to
						be
						sold online only. Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.
					</p>

					<p>And something else few people are aware of is that utility companies overload circuits, which in
						turn
						shortens the lifespan of appliances.
						<b>The Stop Watt helps household appliance by boosting their life-cycle.</b> Which means
						the
						Stop Watt will quickly pay for itself.
					</p>

					<p>Power companies are spending millions of dollars lobbying the government to keep it off store
						shelves. Because they know it will eat deep into their massive profits, so they are fighting
						tooth
						and nail to keep it out of homeowner’s hands. It has become Elon's mission to make sure it
						enters
						every American's hands.

					</div>

					<h2>Putting Stop Watt to the Test...</h2>

					<p>After Elon got his hands on the first prototype produced, he distibuted them for free to a
						private
						test group tasked with putting the Stop Watt to the test and sharing their results online.
					</p>

					<div class="img">
						<a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">
							<img alt="" src="index_files/sucai1111%20(1).png" style="width:100%;height:auto">
						</a>
					</div>

					<p><b>Erik Dale shared his savings with us and the results were astonishing. “I don’t usually write
							reviews, but I have to share some numbers with you all… In the first month, we saved $100.
							By the second month, $185!!!. This invention only gets smarter over time and continues to
							save. If that isn’t a strong testimonial, I’m not sure what is!”</b>
					</p>
					<div class="img">
						<a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">
							<img alt="" src="index_files/32ee2fda-5e9b-45bc-a1e5-f7c871a554f3.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto">
						</a>
					</div>
					<p>Another tester by the name of David Sansbury wrote in with his review:
						<b>"I’m so surprised by the amount we saved with these Stop Watt devices… literally, you
							just plug them in and that’s it! My wife was shocked when we got our first bill and we saved
							$120! And it’s only gotten better from there… We’ll be customers for life."</b>
					</p>


					<p>With Elon Musk's dream realized and his invention working perfectly, it was time to do some real
						good. They finalized plans to set up manufacturing through a new Tesla backed start-up he
						created
						for Stop Watt. In 2 weeks they had the first 100 consumer models, and set up a plan to
						scale
						up production and
						<b>get a Stop Watt to everyone in the U.S. that wants or needs one by Fall 2023</b>.
					</p>
					<h2>Is It Legal And Can Big Energy Actually Stop Elon?</h2>
					<div class="img">
						<a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">
							<img alt="" src="index_files/974a280b-02c5-4c18-a591-05ff72a3f46c.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto">
						</a>
					</div>
					<p><b>Yes, the Stop Watt is 100% legal to use.</b> There is no risk in using this amazing,
						electricity-saving device. Of course, power companies are not happy that people are using it,
						and
						reducing their profits. But there’s nothing they can do except try their best to keep the
						Stop Watt out of as many homes as they can.</p>
					<p>Considering the cost savings this device can offer, many people expect it to be a big investment.
						However, that is not the case.
						<b>In a country wide effort to expand the awareness of Stop Watt, they are offering our
							readers a limited time EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT.</b>
					</p>

					<p>However, due to so much recent media attention and increased pressure from Big Electric, these
						money-saving tools may become impossible to find soon. And because power companies have been
						trying
						to hide the Stop Watt from the public, many have been banned in retail shops. However,
						thanks
						to the Internet, the word is out and growing in awareness and use among everyday people. And
						they
						are being rewarded with far less power consumption, and longer-running household appliances
						because
						of all the energy it conserves.</p>


					<h2>What Does Elon Musk's Invention Mean for All of Us? </h2>
					<p>
					</p>
					<p>With Winter heating bills here, and cost of living going up,
						<b>the Stop Watt is the cheapest and best way to save money on your electricity bill.</b>


					</p>
					<p>As of this Fall, Elon has delivered on his promise to make
						<strong><a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">Stop Watt</a></strong>
						available to absolutely anyone who wants one to <b>lower their electric bills for good</b>. With
						his
						promise comes surprising affordability too due to everything he learned streamlining
						manufacturing
						for Tesla.


					</p>
					<p>He has now launched a
						<strong><a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">website
								where you
								can get the Stop Watt across North America. </a></strong>,
						and this month, they are running a special 50% sale just to cover his cost of production. He
						wants
						to make sure that
						<b>everyone that wants to fight the electric companies and lower their electricity bill by up to
							90% is able to.</b>
						But you should act now since <u>after Black Friday they announced they could run out any time
							before
							Christmas</u>, or before the power companies succeed in getting it banned.
					</p>

					<p>We got a hold of some of the first Stop Watt and for how well they work, this is an
						amazing
						bargain everyone should snap up before they're sold out.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion: Is it Worth it? </h2>

					<div class="img">
						<a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">

					</div>



					<p>Absolutely, Yes.
					</p>

					<p>First of all, anything Elon touches is a technological wonder.</p>

					<p>On top of that, this Winter is predicted to be colder than normal in <span class="regionName"></span> which means higher electric bills, and record high price hikes
						are being
						planned by the Electric Companies as well.
						<strong><a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">Stop Watt</a></strong>
						is satisfaction <b>guaranteed to lower your electricity bill up to 90%</b>.
					</p>
					<p>The time to buy the Stop Watt is now before this EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT runs out. It's already
						selling like
						crazy you'll quickly see why thousands of Americans have ordered theirs already! The icing on
						the
						cake is the price. If it's still on promotion for under $75 - definitely, pick a few of them up
						before they're gone for good. </p>


					<p>You're probably thinking, given what this tech can do, it probably has to cost a fortune. False!
						<strong><a href="https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/25FXKK44/?source_id=pin&sub1=elontype11" target="_blank">Stop Watt							</a></strong>
						is on sale at the moment. You can get 50% off until the end of the week! (with the EXCLUSIVE
						DISCOUNT to our readers).
